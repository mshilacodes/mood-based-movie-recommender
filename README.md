***Stream bold. Chill with Chilio.***

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Chilio's queer content is significantly underperforming due to critical content discovery and mood-matching failures. Users frequently select titles expecting one emotional experience (e.g., light and humorous) but encounter content with dramatically different emotional tones (e.g., intense and emotionally draining). This fundamental mismatch creates poor viewing experiences, drives user frustration, reduces engagement metrics, and ultimately suppresses viewership for queer content across the platform.

**Current Pain Points:**
- High abandonment rates on queer content within first 15 minutes
- Negative user feedback citing "misleading content descriptions"
- Decreased completion rates compared to mainstream content categories
- Users avoiding queer content due to unpredictable emotional experiences

## OBJECTIVE
To address this critical gap, Chilio is implementing a machine learning-driven mood-based recommendation system specifically designed to personalize queer content discovery. The system will align viewer emotional states with content that matches their desired mood, particularly during high-engagement periods like Pride Month.
